HPM's Introduction to Robotics - ME 639

This is a repository for all codes written for the ME 639 - Introduction to Robotics course offered at IIT Gandhinagar in Fall 2021.

Please collaborate within your groups but either keep your working codes private (not visible to everybody) and only commit at the time of submission or upload at the time of the submission.

Once committed, everybody's code is visible to everybody else. In subsequent submissions, use of ideas from each other's codes from previous submission (which has become public) is permitted. But giving due credit will be appropriate.
